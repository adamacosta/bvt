# CS 6210 Advanced Operating Systems

This module comprises the build verification tester for CS 6210. Currently, only 
the tests for assignment 4, Recoverable Virtual Memory, are complete. Other tests 
are commented out.

To run tests, edit the bvt.sh export directives to point to your own assignment 
directories, then execute `./bvt.sh`.
