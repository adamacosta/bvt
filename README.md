THIS MODULE CONTAINS NO ASSIGNMENT DELIVERABLES!

## Introduction

This module comprises test suites designed to mimic the autograders for Georgia 
Tech OMSCS programming assignments. Each subdirectory contains the BVT for a 
particular course. Currently, this is only CS 6210 Advanced Operating Systems 
and CS 6250 Computer Networking.

## Usage

You can run each bvt directly from the repository. There is no need to install 
anything or move files around on your testing machine. Each course bvt contains 
instructions on environment variables to edit in each execution script that will 
tell the test framework where to find the source code deliverables in your home 
directory. All course-provided code is already in the repository.

## Contributing

Contributions are encouraged, but please only contribute test code and harness 
improvements. This module must never contain solutions to homework assignments.

To contribute, please fork the repository on GitHub and send a pull request.
